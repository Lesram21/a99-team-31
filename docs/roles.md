### Review Manager 
All of us on the team will review the pull requests and sort out any issues with them before merging. We plan to be doing this through our scheduled meetings. 

### Plan Manager
Each of us on the team will be keeping an eye on the overall plan and determining the plan for our individual part of the project. We discussed how we would be approaching our part of the project in the meetings, the documentation for which can be found in planning.md.

### Documentation Manager 
Shriya will be making sure that meetings are documented, as well as updating the Read Me and keeping track of main documentation components of the project. However, all of us will be adding documentation for our individual parts, such as Ryan for the frontend interactions and Lesli for the database endpoints.

### Release Manager 
Ryan will work on the packaging and release process for our application. We will all be making sure that our application is being packaged correctly. 

### Project Manager 
Lesli will be working as the project manager for the team, but we will all be keeping each other accountable and making sure that we are following the rubric and being able to create a minimum viable product for our idea.

### Front End Lead 
Ryan will be working on the frontend for the project and making sure our frontend connects properly with the API endpoints in our server and our databases, as well working on styling the frontend. 

### Back End Lead
Shriya will be working on the functions which retrieve and compute the ratings and difficulty of professors (found in the /lib/ directory), as well as setting up the server and main endpoints. 

### Database Lead 
Lesli will be working on the databases, making it so that a user can create an account, log in, delete their account and have a history of their past courses. All interactions with the frontend will also be logged.
